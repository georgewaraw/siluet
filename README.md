# siluet
is a work-in-progress WebGL game demo made using [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) and [es6-tween](https://github.com/tweenjs/es6-tween) libraries. It supports both desktop and mobile platforms as well as most modern web browsers.

Its visuals are inspired by titles found on early 3D game consoles such as PlayStation and Saturn.
