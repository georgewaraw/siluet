# siluet
is a work-in-progress WebGL game demo made using [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) and [es6-tween](https://github.com/tweenjs/es6-tween) libraries. Its visuals are inspired by early 3D game consoles like PlayStation and Sega Saturn, while the separate map view is inspired by the Nintendo DS. It plays on both desktop and mobile; and although most modern web browsers are supported, for best performance and compatibility (e.g. avoiding inconsistent audio playback and looping), Google Chrome is recommended.
