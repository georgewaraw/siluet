# СИЛУЭТ
is a [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) game demo. It sports a lo-fi look inspired by the early 3D game consoles like PlayStation and Saturn. It plays on both desktop and mobile and supports most modern web browsers. For best performance and compatibility (e.g. avoiding audio-related issues), using Chrome is recommended.

### How to play
since it's just a prototype, the gameplay mechanics are simple: navigate the area in top-down perspective and switch to first-person view to dispose of the enemies. Once all enemies disappear from the first-person view, game will end. The game will end prematurely if both player and enemy land on the same tile more than once.

### Controls
on desktop, navigate the area in top-down perspective by clicking the middle of the screen to move forward and left, right, or bottom of the screen to turn in the appropriate direction. Alternatively, use the WASD or the arrow keys. Change into the first-person view by pressing the G key or the spacebar. In this view, simply use the mouse to aim at the enemies and click to shoot.<br/>
on mobile devices, traverse the area by tapping the screen to move forward and swiping left, right, or down to turn. To enter the first-person view, swipe up. Here, the gun will follow your finger's movement. To shoot an enemy, simply tap on it.
