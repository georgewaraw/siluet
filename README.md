# Силуэт (Silhouette)
is a WebGL game demo made with [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) and [es6-tween](https://github.com/tweenjs/es6-tween) libraries. It sports a lo-fi look inspired by early 3D game consoles like PlayStation and Saturn. It plays on both desktop and mobile and supports most modern web browsers. For best performance and compatibility (e.g. avoiding audio-related issues), using Chrome is recommended.
